      <description>The Brief Prices is a multi-platform web application designed and built for a local, family run business based in South Australia. We have had a long running working relationship together and it was great to work with them to build the next step towards their modern, digital workspace.
The salespeople previously carried paper price books to help them perform their day to day tasks, but this made it costly in both time and resources to make even the smallest updates to the pricing data.</description>
